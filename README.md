### Project Outline
Covid19 has disrupted several industries, and the biking industry is no exception. With several activities not allowed, individuals have resorted to outdoors activities and biking has been a favourite. However, with increased demand many stores have reported low inventory. Simultaneously, there have been increased reports of bike thefts in many cities. 

In Seattle, Wash., there was a 54% increase in reported bicycle thefts. Denver, Colo., has seen around 26% increase in bike theft between 2019-2020, according to the Denver Police Department. As for Boston, Mass., it has climbed from 790 in 2019 to 1015 in the last year, a 28% increase. New York City has similarly seen a nearly 30% spike from March to Sept. 21 of last year when compared to the same period in 2019, according to The New York Times. 

In this project we will explore if similar bike theft trends are observed in Ottawa and Vancouver in Canada.
